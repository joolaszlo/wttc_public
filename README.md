# War Thunder Text Changer

📁 [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/joolaszlo/wttc_public/releases/tag/public)

This is a little side project I’ve been working on for War Thunder players. You can edit some of the in-game messages to say whatever you want. For example, you could replace the standard "Target destroyed" with something a bit more fun, like "Dopamine Shot".
The program contains a few useful links related to War Thunder.

It’s not a finished application yet (i’m a beginner and more experienced in Java – this one’s in Python), but it’s working. 🫡

If you play War Thunder, have some Python skills, and feel like contributing to development, I’d be happy to team up (and make the project open-source).

If you have any fun ideas for features, or if you spot a bug, please let me know.
